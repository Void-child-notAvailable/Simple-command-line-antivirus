Introduction
Over the past few weeks, multiple reports have emerged about the work of KozaliBear, an
infamous group of cybercriminals that are known for breaking into corporate networks and
organizations’ cloud environments. This group is known to use viruses to infect the workstations
of unsuspected employees, gain unauthorized access to classified data and even steal
proprietary information. What makes this group extremely dangerous is the use of ransomware.
Ransomware is a type of malware that locks the user’s personal files until a ransom is paid [1].
Files are encrypted and the only way to get the decryption key is if the victim pays a specified
amount of money. The KozaliBear group has managed to extort millions of money using
ransomware. Finally, they usually ask for money in the form of cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) [2]
since they are not trivial (but not impossible) to trace.
You are a cybersecurity engineer working for a leading manufacturer of automotive
electronics. Last night, your supervisor was informed that one of your competitors was attacked
by KozaliBear, and a ransomware was installed into all of their systems making them practically
unusable. Your supervisor is concerned that you might be the next target or that some of your
workstations might have already been infected. Your competitors have kindly shared with you,
Indicators of Compromise (IoC) [3]. These are digital evidence that suggest that a system may
have been breached. You have been tasked to improve the security infrastructure of your
company. You are required to ensure that your systems have not been compromised and to
create a secure environment, where highly confidential files can be stored securely. Finally, you
would like to support other cybersecurity engineers and help them detect this specific attack.
